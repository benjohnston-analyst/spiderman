A repo housing python files and notebooks that handles the web crawling of the West Sussex Connect to Support government website

The code housed here utilises BeautifulSoup to crawl through the website and create a dictionary of urls and where they originated from and then looks for instances of 404 errors or "Page not Found" and outputs a csv.
